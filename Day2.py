# strings in pytohn are a sequence of characters
# it is an immutable data type
# means that that once you have created a string it cannot be changed
# strings are mainly used to store and manipulate the text data.

# the declaratio of string is given as below
# string_1 = "this is just a test string"
# string_2 = "this is another string statement."
# print(string_1+string_2)


# value = 101
# print(type(value))


# print(list(value))

# this is an example of multiline comments

# new  = '''ohoi matey his is your nightmare'''
# print(new)


# value = 'Ram'
# for i in range(len(value)):z
#     print("index"i,value[i])

# print(value[2])

Question for pratice
email id by validating the following rules:

'''

# def verify(email):
#     valid=False
#     if email.split('@')[1] in ['gmail.com','yahoo.com']:
#         valid=True
#     count=0

#     for c in range (len(email)-1):
#         if email[c]==email[c+1]:
#             count+=1
#         if email[c]=='.':
#             email.replace('.','+')
#             valid = True
#     if valid and count<2:
#         print(email)
#         return True

# email = "raaju.ram@gmailcom"
# print(verify(email))

# lists are just dynamically sized arrays
# it is a clooection of object encloded in suare brackets separeated by a coma
# lis tis sequntia data which is used to store the collecrio of data
# the syntax to declare a list is as follws

# list_l = ['efef0','saefg']



# list_l = [1,2,3,4,4]

# def rotate(start,stop,list):
#     while(start<stop):
#         list(start),list(stop) = list(stop),list(start)
#         start+=1
#         stop-=1

# list1 = [1,2,3,4,4]
# key=2
# rotate(0,key-1,list1)
# rotate(key,len(list1)-1,list1)
# rotate(0,len(list1)-1,list1)
# print(list1)


# def stepcleancount(totaltiles , pos):
#     step count

# tuples is a sequence of values stored in enclosed parenthesis
# tuplea are created by using the sequence of values separated by comma with parenthesis
# creating a tuple ithou the parenthesis is known as the tuple packet.

# example of an empty tuple = new={}
# value = {}
# print(value)
# value = ('Raju' , 'ram')
# print(value)
# value = tuple('raju')
# print(value)

# accessing tuple through indexes
# we can also make this using the type casting method


'''Question 
you are given a text data where you would ahe to filter the daata on certain rules
1) Get the first name 
2)get the last four characters in null 'number
3)get any text data from address with starts with number ''

'''

# name = 'Aadhaar koul'
# for i in name :
#     if()

# consider that you have a list with values in nested from 
# where if the values are present in the second list make it zero and find the sum'''



# Dictionary is a collection if key , alue pairs used to store dat avalues like a map.
# unlike other data types which hold a single value the key value os provided in a dictionary to make it more optimized .
# Dictonary internally uses a adata str know as a hash map;
# table which stores the values in keys.

# hash map uses the hash functio in order to use the hash function
# 3:300
# hash function is something like equal to hash of 3 the internally the hash function is considered as the three or one 
# value = 
# {
    
# }

# i =12
# new = 1
# while(new <= 20):
#     print("*"*i)
#     # while(new <= 20):
#     #     print("*"*i)


# dict = {
#     string = "ioifnnbifnbiefnbe"
#     for i in mydict.update(list)
# }

'''

the major advantage of using a set is it is highl optimized method checking if an element is present or not 
the elements are /....the big oh of N
4,4,6,7,9
big oh of 1 is the time complextity for calc the time comp of a program


'''

'''
a set is creatd using a build in set method with an iterable object or a sequence by placcig the sequence inside the curly brace separated by comma'''

# a set cannot have mutable elements like a list a dictionary as it is mutable .
# 
# set 1 = set()
# empty set 
# set1 = set("Hello world")

# # it will not be stored in the same order 

# print(set1)

# print(set1)
# sat1 =
